    cpx #5
    beq l1
    lda #$4d
    .byte $2c         ; bit $53ad ... essentially turns the next two bytes into 3 byte no-op that only affects the flags so that it can fall through
la  lda #$53
    jmp whatever

 A smart way to decrement a 2-byte number:

		LDA LO
		BNE :CONT
		DEC HI
	:CONT	DEC LO

(one of many useful Raeto West tricks).

You don't have a scanline counter, do you?
Else you could do:
; assuming Y is the scanline counter, counting down
  cpy M0end
  rol
  rol		 ; as long as Y is >= M0end, this results into bit 1 set.

    What are best practises in sprite positioning?
For positioning a sprite on the very right, either you position it on the very left with RESPx and then move it further left, or you position it very right with RESPx and the move it further right.
